```


## Data Preprocessing 
In this section, appropriate filtering and pre-processing of the data will be carried out. 


### Countries of Interest
The countries of interest in this paper are: Denmark, Italy, Spain, England, Latvia. In the hbsc2014 dataframe, all countries are denoted with a country-number, however this is rather confusing, thus we rename the country-number in accordance with the actual country-name (Denmark = 208000, Italy = 380000, Spain = 724000, England = 826001, Latvia = 428000)  

```{r}
# Filtering the five countries 
dat2014 <- hbsc2014 %>% 
   filter(COUNTRYno == 208000 | COUNTRYno == 380000 | COUNTRYno == 724000 | COUNTRYno == 826001 | COUNTRYno == 428000 ) %>% 
  rename(countryno = COUNTRYno,
         surveyyear = year,
         uniqueid = UniqueID) # renaming it to match the others 

# a little data was collected in 2013, this is renamed to 2014 for further analysis
dat2014$surveyyear <- ifelse(dat2014$surveyyear== 2013, 2014, 2014)# making all data from 2013 into 2014
```
Apparently England had some data from 2013 as the only country, we changed this data to being 2014


```{r}
# renaming countries in a function
rename_func <- function(data){
data$country_name <- (ifelse(data$countryno == "208000","Denmark", ifelse(data$countryno == "380000", "Italy", ifelse(data$countryno == "724000","Spain", ifelse(data$countryno == "826001","England", ifelse(data$countryno == "428000","Latvia", ifelse(data$countryno == "80400", "Ukraine", NA)))))))
return(data)                                                                
}

#using the function and checking data 
# dat2014
dat2014 <- rename_func(dat2014)
unique(dat2014$country_name)
```



### Further Subsetting
First we will subset the data of interest for model building.
```{r}
#Check we only have data from 2014
unique(hbsc2014$HBSC)

#subset the important variables 
subset_df2014 <- dat2014 %>% 
  select(uniqueid,AGE,sex, #general variables
         lifesat,#mental health variable
         breakfastwd, breakfastwe, fruits, toothbr,sweets, vegetables, ondiet# nutritional variables
         )

```


### Replace NAs
Then we will identify and replace NA's with the mean
```{r}
#Replace NA's with mean (note makes everything numeric)
subset_df2014[subset_df2014==-99] <- NA #some rows may contain -99 instead of NA (replace then)
subset_df2014[subset_df2014=="NaN"] <- NA #some rows may contain NaN instead of NA (replace then)

subset_df2014 <- subset_df2014 %>% 
  mutate_if(is.numeric, ~replace_na(.,mean(., na.rm = TRUE))) %>% 
  round(digits = 0)
```

Finally country-name is added to the dataframe since it disturbed previous work by being a character class
```{r}
#Adding country to the dataframe 
subset_df2014 <- cbind(subset_df2014, country= dat2014$country_name)

#making country a factor
subset_df2014$country <- as.factor(subset_df2014$country)
```


### Plotting Countries
```{r}
country_plot<- ggplot(subset_df2014, aes(x= country, y=lifesat, colour =country)) + geom_point(stat="summary", fun.y="mean") + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(width = 0.1), stat="summary", fun.data="mean_se", fun.args = list(mult = 10))+ggtitle("")+
  stat_summary(fun.y=mean, aes(group=1), geom="line", colour="grey") +
  stat_summary(fun.y=mean, aes(group=1), geom="point", colour="grey", size=1)+
  labs(x = "Countries", y = "Life Satisfaction") + theme(text=element_text(size=13, family="Georgia"))
  
#rename legend
update_labels(country_plot, list(colour="Country"))
```



## Analysis
In this section we will model nutritional factors and mental health in order to investigate their relationship.

### Models
Various of models are constructed to model nutritional factors on mental health in order to find the best fitting model.
```{r}
## mental health ~ nutritional factors

#####country as random intercept

MH_m2 <- lmer(lifesat ~ breakfastwd+ breakfastwe+ (1 | country), subset_df2014)

### Model Comparison

In this section we will compare the best fitting models by evaluating AIC and BIC.
```{r}
#writing AIC values down
MH_aic <- AIC(MH_m1, MH_m2,MH_m3, MH_m4, MH_m5, MH_m6, MH_m7, MH_m8,MH_m9,MH_m10, MH_m11, MH_m12, MH_m13, MH_m14, MH_m15, MH_m16, MH_m17, MH_m18, MH_m19, MH_m20, MH_m21, MH_m22, MH_m23, MH_m24, MH_m25, MH_m26, MH_m27, MH_m28, MH_m29, MH_m30, MH_m31, MH_m32, MH_m33)


#writing down BIC values
MH_bic <- BIC(MH_m1, MH_m2,MH_m3, MH_m4, MH_m5, MH_m6, MH_m7, MH_m8,MH_m9,MH_m10, MH_m11, MH_m12, MH_m13, MH_m14, MH_m15, MH_m16, MH_m17, MH_m18, MH_m19, MH_m20, MH_m21, MH_m22, MH_m23, MH_m24, MH_m25, MH_m26, MH_m27, MH_m28, MH_m29, MH_m30, MH_m31, MH_m32, MH_m33)


#putting results into one dataframe:
MH_df <- tibble(Model = c("MH_m1", "MH_m2","MH_m3", "MH_m4", "MH_m5", "MH_m6", "MH_m7", "MH_m8","MH_m9","MH_m10", "MH_m11", "MH_m12", "MH_m13", "MH_m14", "MH_m15", "MH_m16", "MH_m17", "MH_m18", "MH_m19", "MH_m20", "MH_m21", "MH_m22", "MH_m23", "MH_m24", "MH_m25", "MH_m26", "MH_m27", "MH_m28", "MH_m29", "MH_m30", "MH_m31", "MH_m32", "MH_m33"), BIC=MH_bic$BIC, AIC=MH_aic$AIC)
```

```{r}
head(MH_df[order(MH_df$BIC, decreasing= F),], n = 3) #best models
```
The model that performs the best is Model 12 (MH_m12) with a BIC = 120043.8 and AIC = 119944.1, and Model 11 (MH_m11) with a BIC = 120058.9 and AIC = 119967.5. However, Model 6 (MH_m6) makes conceptually better sense as we account for baseline-differences in life satisfaction of each country, and thus takes more variability in to account. The conceptually better Model 6 (MH_m6), does only perform minimally worse than Model 12 with a BIC= 120085.8 and AIC = 120011.0.


## Results

### Results of the Model

```{r}
#printing summary of the model
summary(MH_m6)
```
The summary yields how all fixed effects are significant, however the random effects are not significant. This will be elaborated on in the paper. 


### Cross-Country Stats

Calculating mean and standard deviation of life satisfaction for each country
```{r}
#Denmark 
mean(subset_df2014[subset_df2014$country == 'Denmark', 'lifesat'])
sd(subset_df2014[subset_df2014$country == 'Denmark', 'lifesat'])

#England
mean(subset_df2014[subset_df2014$country == 'England', 'lifesat'])
sd(subset_df2014[subset_df2014$country == 'England', 'lifesat'])


#Italy
mean(subset_df2014[subset_df2014$country == 'Italy', 'lifesat'])
sd(subset_df2014[subset_df2014$country == 'Italy', 'lifesat'])

#Latvia
mean(subset_df2014[subset_df2014$country == 'Latvia', 'lifesat'])
sd(subset_df2014[subset_df2014$country == 'Latvia', 'lifesat'])

#Spain
mean(subset_df2014[subset_df2014$country == 'Spain', 'lifesat'])
sd(subset_df2014[subset_df2014$country == 'Spain', 'lifesat'])
